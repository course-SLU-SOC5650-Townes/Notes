## Introduction
This is the R Notebook for [Assignment] in SOC5650 Spring 2018.

## Project Set Up
The following code enables the R Notebook to integrate seemlessly with the project organization format used in the course. This is normally included in the R Notebook but currently is causing an error. Per Dr. Chris Prener, the error is generated because the `here::here()` function has not been tested with the specific combination of functions that we use in this course (see SOC 5650 Spring 2018 Lecture 03 web page section about `here()` solution.) To work around this problem, I've embedded the `here()` function where I would normally enter a file path of some kind. 
```{r setup-project}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```

## Load Dependencies
The following code loads package dependencies required to complete the assignment. Basic tasks include importing, reading, wrangling, and cleaning data; creating new variables; and creating shapefiles. 
```{r load-dependencies}
library(tidyverse) # loads the basic R packages
library(here) # enables file portability
library(readr) # functions for reading data
library(dplyr) # functions for data wrangling
library(janitor) # functions for data cleaning
library(naniar) # functions for analyzing missing data
library(sf) # simple features for R
library(ggplot2) # functions for plotting
library(ggthemes) # themes, scales, and geoms for ggplot2
library(measurements) # functions for unit measurements
library(RColorBrewer) # color ramps
library(viridis) # color ramps
library(leaflet) # create web maps
```
